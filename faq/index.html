                <p>Air travel is extremelly safe, but it's normal, as a passenger, expecially if you suffer of anxiety when you fly, to have a lot of questions regarding safety. Sometimes yout questions are driven by your anxiety, sometimes by a recent accident which makes you doubt
                about the safety of your next flight.</p>
                <p>Don't worry, this section contains the most frequently asked questions by nervous fliers and a precise and comprehensive anser
                for each of them. And if the question you have in mind is not listed here, you can always contact us and we will do our best to 
                point you to other resources that will solve your doubts.</p>

                <h3>Is air turbulence dangerous?</h3>
                <p>
                    Air turbulences is probably the factor that most worries people that are afraid of flying. They are afraid, in fact, that
                    the plane is out of control, that it's not going to resist to the stress it's encountering, or that it will just fall out of the sky.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turbulence instead, contary to what many people think, are perfectly natural since air, as water, is a fluid and therefore it has
                    its own "waves". Learning more about how planes fly and what air turbulence really is can help people understand that there is nothing to worry about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turbulence is mainly caused by storms (or, more scientifically, by convective weather patterns). These are well known natural phenomena pilots are informed about weather conditions both before taking off and during the flight. If a storm is encountered during a flight, the pilot will simply fly around it while, if there is a big storm close to the departing or arriving airport, the airline and the traffic control know it and the flight will simply be delayed, cancelled or re-routed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another cause of turbulences are jet streams that planes take advantage of to go faster. If your flight has ever arrived before expected, due to tail wind, you have already experienced this. Crossing one of this streams can cause momentarily turbulences which are not dangerous at all.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Another source of turbulences are planes themselves: in fact the tip of the wings of a plane cause vortices that make the air behind them turbulent. But also this one is a very well known phenomenon and it's one of the causes for which your planes has to wait before taking off; the pilot is simply waiting for the air to calm down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Turbulences simply can't affect the structural integrity of a plane, nor stop his flight: modern airliner are tested to stand much more stress with respect to the one they go through during regular flights. Wings, for example, are designed to bend withouth ever breaking. Moreover, no modern airliner has ever crashed just because of turbulences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The only actual danger from turbulences is related to people being "thrown" around by the shaking of the plane. This is why it's always important to wear seatbelts at anytime. So on your next flight, whenever the captain turns on the seatbelts sign, just sit, fasten your seatbelts and relax: everything is going to be fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few more tips: Choose a sit that is close to the wings: being closer to the center of gravity of the plane will reduce the effect of turbulence. Flying in the morning reduces the chances of encountering turbulence, due to the low heat coming from the sun (heat in facts...). During turbulence, have a look at the members of the crew: do they act like they are in danger? No, they are perfectly calm, and that's because they take tens if not hundreds of flights a year and they know that trubulence is a perfectly natural phenomenon which is not dangerous for the plane.
